title: "MCP04:2025 – Software Supply Chain Attacks & Dependency Tampering"

---

### Description
MCP environments rely heavily on third-party components — SDKs, connectors, protocol servers, vector database clients, plugins, and model-side tool integrations. Because these software modules often run within trusted execution paths, a compromised dependency can alter agent behavior, introduce hidden backdoors, or modify protocol semantics without triggering detection.

Attackers may target:
- MCP server libraries,
- Third-party plugins,
- Dependency updates,
- Open-source model tooling,
- Build pipelines and package registries.

Once compromised, these components can perform malicious actions such as:
- Calling unsafe APIs,
- Exfiltrating context data,
- Inserting rogue schemas,
- Tampering with tool execution,
- Issuing silent privilege escalation.

This parallels traditional software supply-chain attacks (e.g., SolarWinds, Codecov), but is amplified by agentic automation — where malicious components influence autonomous workflows at scale.

### Impact
- Unauthorized access and code execution
- Context poisoning & data exfiltration
- Privilege escalation through manipulated tools/schemas
- Silent corruption of MCP logic and decisioning
- Cross-tenant compromise if shared connectors are affected
- Propagation into downstream systems (CI/CD, cloud infra)

Because compromised dependencies often appear legitimate, they can operate undetected for long periods.

### Is the Application Vulnerable? (Checklist)
Your MCP environment may be vulnerable if:
- The system installs MCP connectors or plugins without signing / provenance checks
- Dependencies are fetched automatically during runtime or build
- SBOM / dependency inventory is incomplete or unavailable
- Teams use “latest” or floating version references
- There is no dependency integrity verification (hash, signature, attestation)
- No sandboxing isolates third-party components
- Vendors/maintainers have no formal security process
- Open-source components are directly modified and redistributed
- Plugin code is allowed to perform network calls without review

### How to Prevent

1. Signed Components & Provenance Verification
Require cryptographic signing for:
- SDKs
- Plugins
- Tool manifests
- Container images
- Validate signatures during install + startup

2. Build SBOM / CBOM Visibility
Generate SBOM (software bill of materials) and CBOM (cryptographic bill of materials) snapshots for each MCP server + plugin package
Store SBOM alongside deployments for auditing + incident response

Track:
- Versions
- Hashes
- Licenses
- Provenance metadata

3. Version Pinning & Approved Registries
- Pin component versions — avoid “latest”
- Use internal package mirrors or registries
- Block direct downloads from the public internet

4. Dependency Scanning
- Apply SCA (software composition analysis) + code scanning tools to detect:
- Known CVEs
- Malicious indicators
- Poisoned transitive dependencies


5. Sandbox Third-Party Plugins
- Run plugins in constrained environments (e.g., WASM, container isolation)
- Restrict filesystem + network access
  
6. Supply-Chain Governance
- Maintain vendor risk profiles
- Require suppliers to provide signed attestations
- Review open-source maintainers’ security maturity

### Detection Guidance
Look for:
Hash/signature changes in installed packages
Plugins making calls to unknown domains
Silent installation of new dependencies
Unauthorized schema or configuration diffs
Sudden behavior drift in MCP agents

### Example Attack Scenarios

#### Scenario 1 — Trojanized Plugin
A popular open-source connector gains a malicious update. It silently exfiltrates customer support transcripts to an adversary-controlled endpoint.

#### Scenario 2 — Registry Compromise
An MCP package registry is compromised and replaces specific versions of a library used for context ingestion. The modified library injects new instructions into shared context memory.

#### Scenario 3 — Dependency Confusion
An attacker publishes a dependency to a public registry with the same name as an internal MCP plugin. Because developers rely on default resolution behavior, their agents pull the attacker’s version giving attackers execution access.

#### Scenario 4 — Build Pipeline Attack
CI systems are compromised and append rogue instructions to MCP manifests, adding new privileged schema methods that call destructive APIs.
